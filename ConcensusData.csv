Another important adaptation strategy is the development of climate-resilient infrastructure. This includes buildings, roads, and other infrastructure to resist dangerous weather actions like hurricanes, floods, and wildfires. Agricultural practices can also be adapted to mitigate the impacts of climate change. For example, farmers can adopt conservation tillage practices, which involve leaving crop deposits on the field after yield, reducing the amount of soil erosion, and improving soil health. They can also switch to drought-resistant crops requiring less water and more resilient to extreme weather conditions. Education and awareness-raising are also important mitigation and adaptation strategies"

The health frame has gained traction since the Paris COP21 (United Nations Climate Change Conference) and arguably helped to achieve modest progress at the Glasgow COP26. However, reporting rarely covers the full picture of health impacts from EWEs, instead focusing on cost of damages, mortality, and displacement. This review summarizes data for 30 major EWEs of 2021 and, based on the epidemiological literature, discusses morbidity-related exposures for four hazards that marked the year: wildfire smoke; extreme cold and power outages; extreme, precipitation-related flooding; and drought. A very large likely burden of morbidity was found, with particularly widespread exposure to risk of respiratory outcomes (including interactions with COVID-19) and mental illnesses. There is need for a well-disseminated global annual report on EWE morbidity, including affected population estimates and evolving science. In this way, the public health frame may be harnessed to bolster evidence for the broader and promising frame of â€œurgency and agencyâ€ for climate change action./ International Journal of Social Determinants of Health and Health Services ","Sheehan, 2022",Editorial comment piece; Systematic review; Economic analysis,,,No,Other: Morbidity ,Flood; Drought; Air quality,None,,,Summarizes 30 major EWEs of 2021 and discusses deaths related to these events

air: men, working-age adults, non-Hispanic Whites, and adults with no college education. By contrast, we find no evidence that smoke pollution increases suicide risk among any urban demographic group "
